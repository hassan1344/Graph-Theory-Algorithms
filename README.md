# Graph-Theory-Algorithms
Data was read from txt files and graphs were drawn using python libraries (matplotlib, networkx). After drawing the graphs, different graph theory algorithms were implemented and the desired output is displayed. The UI was built using tkinter library.

## Virtual environment should be enabled as the python interpreter in the IDE ##

# Steps to run the program : 

1. Run the ui.py file.
2. Select the desired algorithm and no.of nodes (which will be read from the file).
3. Click the Submit button

**** You will see the desired output in form of numeric values and graphs ****
